Make a picture of a 3D action figure toy, named "YOUR-NAME-HERE" Make it look like it's being displayed in a transparent plastic package, blister packaging model. The figure is as in the photo, [GENDER/HIS/HER/THEIR] style is very [DEFINE EVERYTHING ABOUT HAIR/FACE/ETC]. On the top of the packaging there is a large writing: "[NAME-AGAIN]" in white text then below it "[TITLE]‚Äù Dressed in [CLOTHING/ACCESSORIES]. Also add some supporting items for the job next to the figure, like [ALL-THE-THINGS]. The packaging design is minimalist, cardboard colour, cute toy style sold in stores. The style is cartoonish, cute but still neat, also put [BRAND] logo in the top right corner
